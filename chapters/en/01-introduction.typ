The #pkg("econ-viz") package is a Python toolkit for producing
publication-quality microeconomics diagrams: indifference curves, budget
constraints, consumer equilibria, demand curves and exchange economies. It
draws in the conventions of textbook figures---first-quadrant axes with
arrow tips, #LaTeX;-style labels and no numeric ticks---and exports to PNG,
PDF, SVG, TikZ or animated GIF.

== Scope

#pkg("econ-viz") is organised in five parts: utility models, equilibrium solving, utility levels, drawing layers, and output formats. Models and solutions remain usable on their own, and the same model can be passed to a canvas, multi-panel figure, demand diagram, or analysis API.

== Reading guide

The manual is organised in four parts (@tab-guide):

On first use, read @sec-quickstart and @sec-canvas in order. To look up a
particular API, go straight to its section or to the command index.
